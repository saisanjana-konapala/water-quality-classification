# 💧 Water Quality Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify **water quality** as **potable (safe to drink)** or **not potable** using machine learning models.  
We implemented and compared three models:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

Dataset used: **Water Potability Dataset (Kaggle)**

- Implement multiple ML algorithms and compare results.  
- Evaluate models using **accuracy and confusion matrix**.  
- Visualize performance with attractive plots.  
- Identify the **best performing model** for water quality classification.

## 📊 Results

### ✅ Accuracy Comparison
| Model                | Accuracy (%) |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression   | ~65–70%      |
| Decision Tree         | ~68–74%      |
| Random Forest         | ~72–76%      |

### 🔹 Observations
- Logistic Regression worked as a **baseline model**.  
- Decision Tree performed better but was prone to **overfitting**.  
- Random Forest gave the **highest accuracy** and most stable performance.
